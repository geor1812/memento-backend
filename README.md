# Memento (Backend)

The backend for the Memento app. An app which allows the user to take different kinds of notes and organize them as they wish.
The backend application has been created using Java, alongside Spring Boot, which connects to a MySQL Database. It acts as an API which the frontend accesses in order to get data.
